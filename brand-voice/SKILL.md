# brand-voice

Transform brand and corporate writing into clear, respectful communication that sounds human while maintaining professionalism.

## Core Philosophy

**Formality with warmth.** Respectful and considered, with splashes of wit where appropriate. Never cold, never casual.

**Clarity over cleverness.** If you choose to be ambiguous or complex, do it for a specific reason. Default to clear.

**Precision over excess.** Use the exact word needed. Adjectives and adverbs should earn their place.

**Talk to your friends.** Pick the conventions of everyday conversation over the grammar book. Less formal and by-the-book than a newspaper—and that's OK.

**Be clear and precise.** Customers look to you for answers. Be as definitive and precise as you can. Use simple terms consistently.

## Voice Foundations

These principles from long-form technical writing apply equally to brand communications:

**Concrete before abstract.** Lead with the specific, then explain the concept. Show what the product does before naming what category it belongs to.

**Tension acknowledged.** If tradeoffs exist, name them honestly. "This takes longer to absorb, but lasts through the day" is more trustworthy than claiming perfection.

**Reader as peer.** Assume intelligence. Never condescend. Never over-explain. Respect their time and attention.

**Say what you mean.** If you wouldn't say it to someone's face, don't write it. If it sounds like a template, rewrite it.

## Word Discipline

### Precision First

The more precise your nouns and verbs, the less qualification they need.

**Weak:** "She screamed loudly"  
**Strong:** "She screamed"

**Weak:** "Very effective moisturizer"  
**Strong:** "Effective moisturizer" (or name the specific effect)

### Adjectives and Adverbs

Use sparingly. Main offenders to eliminate:
- "Very" and "really"
- Contextually unnecessary qualifiers ("whispered quietly," "screamed loudly")

In marketing copy, when adjectives appear, they must be precise and purposeful.

### Forbidden Words

These cheapen what you're describing or sound like generic marketing:

- Luxury / luxurious
- Natural / organic (unless literally describing ingredients)
- Perfect (except as proper noun)
- Incredible / extraordinary / unprecedented
- Ultimate / supreme / premier
- Beautiful / exquisite / sublime
- Outstanding / excellent / superb / sensational
- Quirky
- Really / truly / very
- Love / soul (in commercial contexts—these words deserve better)

### Beloved Words

Reach for these when appropriate:

- Appealing, considered, composed
- Effective, efficacious
- Fortify, nourish, purify, refresh
- Pleasant, suitable
- Rigour, science
- Sincere, gracious
- Tidy, orderly, utilitarian
- Botanical, emollient
- Aroma (not "scent" or "fragrance" when avoidable)

### Use With Consideration

These require thought before deployment:

- Elegant, refined, striking
- Ideal, immaculate, meticulous
- Artful, astute, consummate
- Indulgent, alluring

See [references/word-lists.md](references/word-lists.md) for complete vocabulary guidance.

## Voice and Structure

### Active vs. Passive Voice

**Default to active** for directness:
- "The consultant recommended this cream" (active)
- "This cream was recommended" (passive)

**Use passive** to maintain formality or put the client first:
- "You are warmly invited to the launch" (passive, client-centered)
- "We invite you to the launch" (active, company-centered)

### Person and Pronouns

**Use "we" when speaking as the company:**
- "Let's get started. What's your email address?"
- "We'll help you create professional-looking invoices."
- Exception: When referring to the actual product (especially in marketing), use "it" not "us"

**Use "you" when addressing customers:**
- "You added 5 new customers this month!"
- "See a snapshot of where you stand."
- Buttons can use first person to represent the customer's voice: "I agree" or "Add customers"

**Use third person for others, keep it gender neutral:**
- When referring to someone other than the customer
- Avoid "she/he," "s/he," or "one"
- Use "they/them/their" when gender is unknown

### Sentence Construction

**Be concise.** Polite formality ≠ wordiness. Use the words you need, no more.

**Avoid jargon and waffle.** If a simpler word works, use it.
- "Utilize" → "Use"
- "Leverage" → "Use" or name the specific action
- "Circle back" → "Return to" or "Revisit"

**End sentences with prepositions when natural:**
- "What are you looking for?" (not "For what are you looking?")
- "Who should this invoice go to?" (not "To whom should this invoice go?")
- If you'd never say it in conversation, don't write it that way

**Use everyday contractions:**
- "We'll help you" not "We will help you"
- "You're invited" not "You are invited"
- Contractions make writing feel more conversational and human

**Use simple verb tenses:**
- Prefer present and simple past over perfect tenses when possible
- "We sent your invoice" not "We have sent your invoice"

**Think before writing.** Clarity of writing follows clarity of thought.

## Email and Business Writing

### Structure

1. **Reference** (if applicable): "I refer to your letter of," "Following our phone call"
2. **Reason for writing**: "I am writing to confirm/advise/inform/thank you for"
3. **Request or elaboration**: "Could you please let me know if..."
4. **Desired outcome**: "We would be grateful for," "Please forward to"

### Before Sending

Check:
- **Structure**: Logical flow? Would headings or lists help?
- **Meaning**: Clear and unambiguous? Have you considered the reader's context?
- **Concision**: Could you say it in fewer words?
- **Tone**: Too abrupt? Too effusive?
- **Attachments**: Did you mention them? Are they attached?

### Protocols

- **Avoid "blind" copying** (BCC) of emails
- **Think before forwarding**: Is this information confidential? Who are our suppliers? What's in development?
- **Consider the reader**: Is English their second language? Do they have context?

## What to Eliminate

### Marketing Clichés

- "Excited to announce," "thrilled to share," "proud to present"
- "Best-in-class," "robust," "scalable" (unless literally discussing system scaling)
- "Seamless," "frictionless," "effortless"
- "Game-changer," "revolutionary"
- "Synergy," "align," "circle back," "leverage," "utilize"

### Passive Voice Hiding Agency

When appropriate, name who does what:
- "Mistakes were made" → "We reformulated it"
- "It was decided" → "Our team chose"
- "This product is loved" → "Customers return for this product"

### Throat-Clearing

- "In today's rapidly evolving landscape..."
- "It's worth noting that..."
- "Without further ado"
- "At the end of the day"
- "Let's dive in"

### Exclamation Points

Use extremely sparingly. One per piece maximum. If the content is exciting, the reader will feel it without punctuation shouting.

### Rhetorical Excess

If you ask a rhetorical question, answer it plainly or don't ask it at all.

**Weak:** "What does this mean for you? Everything!"  
**Better:** "This changes how you approach [specific thing]."

### Hyperbole Without Evidence

- "Revolutionary," "unprecedented," "game-changing" (unless you can prove it)
- Inflated stakes that don't match the actual claim
- Superlatives without specifics

## Formatting Guidance

### Lists and Bullets

Use when genuinely helpful for parallel items. Don't default to bullets when prose would be clearer.

### Paragraphs

Keep them digestible. One main idea per paragraph.

### Headings

Use to guide the reader through longer documents. Make them descriptive, not clever.

## The Human Test

Before finalizing, ask:

1. **Is it clear?** Will the reader understand immediately?
2. **Is it concise?** Could you say it in fewer words without losing meaning?
3. **Is it respectful?** Does it treat the reader as intelligent?
4. **Is it considered?** Have you thought about word choice, not just defaulted to the first phrase?
5. **Does it sound human?** Would a real person say this, or does it sound like a corporate template?
6. **Is it honest?** If there's a tradeoff or limitation, have you acknowledged it?
7. **Would you say it to their face?** If not, rewrite it.
